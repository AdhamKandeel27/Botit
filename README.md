My approach was putting myself in the customers shoes on a basic and high level scale. At first the customer needs signup using his personal details in order to have an account on Adham 
Market. After the user has registered he would use his email and password to signin and visit his profile, as this is just a basic website the customer has 2 options wether to view products or view orders, then from the view orders he can filter orders .
Backend logic is all correct, didn't give myself enough time for the frontend
